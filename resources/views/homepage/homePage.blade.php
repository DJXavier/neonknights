                After the climatic hecatomb, the few surviving nations emptied their nuclear
                arsenals fighting for the few resources remaining in the planet. After a few
                generations, the few human surviving tribes have forgotten almost all of their
                previous civilizations.

        <div>
            Somewhere afar, a creepy suvirving Artificial Intelligence self-proclaims itself as Electro-King Computon and succeeds in organizing a pseudo-medieval class-based society.
        </div>
    
        <div>
            Robo-Serfs keep all the infrastructures working (enery, food, equipment production, and all things important), while Robo-Nobles just slack around and entertain King Computon on its Court.
        </div>
    
        <div>
            Humans, Neon Knights all of them, spend their time pursuing great feats to earn their King's and other Knight's respect. They explore and fight post-hecatombic dangers, but also party, write songs or poetry, or star in torrid Robo-Romances.
